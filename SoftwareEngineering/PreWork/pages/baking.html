	<p id="introduction">As you can see I have organized the level of difficulty of treats I have baked in the past.</p>

	<div id="div4">
		Basic Cookies: Easiest to make especially when following the cookie mix instructions.
	</div>	

	<div id="div5">
		Cupcakes: Similarly like the cookies, made by following the instructions of the cupcake mix but with more utensils.
	</div>
	
	<div id="div6">
		Mararons: Are the most difficult because they are time, temperature, and mix sensitive.
	</div>
